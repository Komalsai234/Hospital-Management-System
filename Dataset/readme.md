# Synthetic Data Generation

The synthetic dataset has been meticulously generated to mirror the complexity and diversity of actual hospital data, albeit in a controlled and privacy-compliant manner. The dataset encompasses the following:

- Patient Data 🙍‍♂️: Approximately 5500 synthetic patient records have been created, encompassing a wide range of demographics, medical histories, and treatment scenarios. This data simulates real-world patient diversity and allows for the testing of patient-related functionalities in the system.

- Medicine Inventory 💊: A catalogue of 5000 synthetic medicine records represents the hospital's pharmacy inventory. This data is crucial for demonstrating the system's pharmacy management capabilities, including prescription handling, stock management, and billing.

- Lab Tests and Reports 📄: The dataset includes a variety of lab test records and associated reports, stored, and managed using MongoDB and GridFS. This aspect of the data is key for showcasing the system's ability to handle large, unstructured data files typical in medical diagnostics.

The synthetic data was generated using a combination of automated scripts and manual inputs, ensuring a realistic distribution of data types and values. Care was taken to ensure that the data is representative of typical hospital scenarios, including variations in patient conditions, treatment plans, and healthcare services.
